Implement other file formats
	also implement .rle more properly

Allow infinite grids using quadtrees
	investigate having "oscilatting" "still" and "active" nodes
		oscilatting -> as long as nothing gets within 2+.5*width of the center,
			we don't update this unless it is on the screen (and then only when
			there is a new frame). We store the period of the structure, and the
			offset. Then we can just mod the generation by the period, add the
			offset, and look up what the new state should be in a table.
		still -> very similar to oscilatting in the regards to switching to
			active. However, these will not need periods or offsets as no matter
			the generation, as long as they are not active they remain the same.
		active -> things that are not oscilatting or still

Implement hashlife
