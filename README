clife is an implementation of Conway's game of life in C.
[the 'c' stands for Conway or 'C', take your pick ;)]

Compiling:
	make

Running:
	./clife <.rle file>
		or
	$(something that outputs a .rle file) | ./clife

	The .rle file is the same as the one Golly uses, except it does not support
	comments or other rulesets at this time.

Controls:
	Once everything dies, the program exits

	Enter: pause or start simulation
	Tab: step one generation into the future
	a: zoom in
	o: zoom out
	Escape: Exit prematurely (and save a screenshot in out.bmp)
